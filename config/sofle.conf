# Debounce Configuration
# To prevent contact bounce (also known as chatter) and noise spikes from causing unwanted key presses
# If you are having problems with a single key press registering multiple inputs, you can try increasing the debounce press and/or release times to compensate. 
# You should also check for mechanical issues that might be causing the bouncing, such as hot swap sockets that are making poor contact. 
# You can try replacing the socket or using some sharp tweezers to bend the contacts back together.
# Default the debounce algorithm decides that a key is pressed or released after the input is stable for 5 milliseconds. 
# You can decrease this to improve latency or increase it to improve reliability.
